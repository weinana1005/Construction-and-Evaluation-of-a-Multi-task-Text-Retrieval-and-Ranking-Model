# Construction-and-Evaluation-of-a-Multi-task-Text-Retrieval-and-Ranking-Model

This repository contains the code and experiments for constructing and evaluating a multi-task model that performs both text retrieval and ranking. The project leverages multi-task learning to jointly optimize for retrieving relevant documents and ranking them based on relevance, providing a unified approach to information retrieval challenges.

## Overview

This project, **Multi-Task Text Retrieval and Ranking Model: Construction and Evaluation**, aims to build a robust multi-task model that simultaneously tackles text retrieval and ranking tasks. By sharing representations between these two tasks, the model is designed to improve performance on both fronts while efficiently handling real-world information retrieval challenges.

---

## Project Objectives

- **Develop a Multi-Task Model:** Build a model that performs both text retrieval (identifying relevant documents) and ranking (ordering them by relevance).
- **Leverage Shared Representations:** Use multi-task learning to share features between retrieval and ranking tasks.
- **Optimize Performance:** Utilize appropriate loss functions and training techniques to maximize both retrieval accuracy and ranking quality.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assess the model using standard metrics such as Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (MAP) for retrieval, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) for ranking.
- **Compare Against Baselines:** Benchmark the multi-task model against traditional single-task approaches.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following components:

- **Embedding Layer:** Converts raw text into vector representations.
- **Shared Encoder:** A deep neural network (e.g., transformer-based encoder) that learns contextual representations of the input text.
- **Task-Specific Layers:**
  - **Retrieval Head:** Outputs a binary (or probabilistic) score indicating document relevance.
  - **Ranking Head:** Outputs scores for ordering the documents, optimized via ranking-specific loss functions.
- **Multi-Task Loss:** A combined loss function that jointly optimizes the retrieval and ranking objectives.

## Data and Preprocessing

- **Data Sources:** The project uses text datasets appropriate for retrieval and ranking tasks. (Please update with specific dataset names or links if available.)
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Tokenization and text normalization
  - Removal of stop words (if applicable)
  - Conversion of text to numerical representations (using word embeddings or contextual embeddings)
- **Data Splitting:** Data is divided into training, validation, and test sets for robust evaluation.

---

## Experiments and Evaluation

- **Training Process:** The model is trained using standard optimization techniques (e.g., SGD or Adam) with careful hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Retrieval:** Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (MAP)
  - **Ranking:** Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation
- **Experiments:** Multiple configurations and hyperparameter settings are explored to determine the best performance on both tasks.
- **Notebook:** Detailed experiments, visualizations, and analysis are provided in the Jupyter Notebook `coursework2.ipynb`.
